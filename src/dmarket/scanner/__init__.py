"""Scanner package for arbitrage scanning functionality.

This package provides modular components for:
- Level configurations (boost, standard, medium, advanced, pro)
- Cache management for API responses
- Item filtering (blacklist/whitelist)
- Arbitrage analysis and profit calculation
- Multi-game scanning
- Aggregated price pre-scanning for fast opportunity detection
- Attribute-based filtering (exterior, float, rarity, etc.)

Usage:
    from src.dmarket.scanner import ArbitrageScanner, ARBITRAGE_LEVELS
    from src.dmarket.scanner import AggregatedScanner, AttributeFilters, PresetFilters

    scanner = ArbitrageScanner(public_key="...", secret_key="...")
    results = await scanner.scan_level("standard", "csgo")

    # Fast pre-scan
    agg_scanner = AggregatedScanner(api_client)
    opportunities = await agg_scanner.pre_scan_opportunities(
        titles=["AK-47 | Redline", "AWP | Asiimov"],
        game="csgo",
        min_margin=0.15
    )

    # Attribute filtering
    filters = AttributeFilters.create_extra_filters(
        exterior=["factory new"],
        float_range=(0.0, 0.07),
        rarity=["covert"]
    )
